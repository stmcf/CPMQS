            Here at CPM we don’t believe you should have to pay for experience or time that you don’t need and as such we do things slightly differently.  With us you pay for hours you need and the QS you need for each task giving you access to an entire commercial department as and when you need it.  We agree a schedule of rates in advance for all levels of commercial support that you can call upon when you need it to ensure your business is commercial and contractually protected while driving efficiency and enhanced margins.
