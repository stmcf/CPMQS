                CPM Quantity Surveying is an SME (Sub)Contractor focused consultancy offering commercial management services on a bespoke and ad-hoc basis.  Having spent a combined 30 years plus experience in commercial roles within the construction industry our management team realised that smaller contractors were under represented on commercial and contractual matters and were compelled to provide a solution. 
           
                We have decided to do things differently and, through a schedule of rates, agreed in advance, we offer the right level of consultant for each task essentially providing a full, on-demand commercial department from Junior QS’s and Commercial Assistants through to Commercial Managers.  This model ensure your business benefits from the knowledge, experience and supervision of our senior consultants without having to pay for them to carry out the day to day commercial tasks.

            Here at CPM we don’t believe you should have to pay for experience or time that you don’t need and as such we do things slightly differently.  With us you pay for hours you need and the QS you need for each task giving you access to an entire commercial department as and when you need it.  We agree a schedule of rates in advance for all levels of commercial support that you can call upon when you need it to ensure your business is commercial and contractually protected while driving efficiency and enhanced margins.
